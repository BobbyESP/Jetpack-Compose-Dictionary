# Jetpack Compose Dictionary
This dictionary is made in Kotlin with the modern UI framework **Jetpack Compose** using Material Design, Retrofit, Room, Flow and other libraries.  For this dictionary, I'm using an Open-Source API [DictionaryAPI](https://dictionaryapi.dev) (consider making a donation).
